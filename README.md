# Advent of Code Shenanigans in Python üêçüéÑ

Welcome, to my humble abode of algorithmic amusement! This repository houses my valiant (and sometimes less-than-valiant) attempts at conquering the yearly Advent of Code challenges.

**What is Advent of Code?**

For the uninitiated, Advent of Code is an annual series of small programming puzzles released every day from December 1st to December 25th. Think of it as an intellectual advent calendar, but instead of chocolate, you get the sweet, sweet dopamine rush of solving a problem with code. And sometimes crippling frustration. Mostly dopamine, though. Definitely.

**Why this repository?**

*   **Learning:** This is a great excuse to sharpen my Python skills and explore new algorithms and data structures.  Plus, code review is always welcome (especially if it's gentle and accompanied by compliments).
*   **Community:**  Maybe you're stuck on a problem and looking for inspiration (or a blatant copy-paste opportunity - no judgment here!).  Feel free to browse, adapt, and contribute!

**Contents:**

Each day's challenge has its own directory (e.g., `day_01`, `day_02`). Inside you'll find:

*   `script.py`:  The Python script for both parts of the challenge. (Because, you know, they always throw in a twist.)
*   `*.txt`:  My personalized input data for that day's challenge. (Feel free to use it for testing, but your mileage may vary!)
*   (Optional) `README.md`: A brief description of my approach and any interesting insights (or epic fails) I encountered.

**Disclaimer:**

I make no guarantees that my solutions are the most efficient, elegant, or even correct.  They are simply *my* solutions.  Use them at your own risk.  And please, don't blame me if you get hopelessly addicted to Advent of Code.  It's a slippery slope.

Happy coding! üéÖ
